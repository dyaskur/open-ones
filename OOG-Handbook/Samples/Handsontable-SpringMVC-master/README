A simple app demonstrating how to transfer data from a Handsontable based client to a SpringMVC server.

Handsontable is a an Excel-like data grid utilising JQuery. It basically provides spreadsheet like functionality.

In this example, the 'spreadsheet' is embedded in a JSP/JavaScript/Jquery client, talking to a SpringMVC server via a Json/Ajax call.
The server is very simple and simply echos the data back to the client, but is none the less fully tested with JUnit and Selenium tests.

The example is deployed at Handsontable-SpringMVC.shaunabram.cloudbees.net
